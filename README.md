CPSC 581 Project by Nathan Lum, Victor Dong, Parker Smith, and Michaela Gilchrist

A project focused on augmenting in-person and online communication and/or collaboration

Jam Sesh is a fun way to jam with your friends over the internet. A great way to play together without needing to be in the same room. Users can choose between three instruments: piano, snare, and tambourine. 
There is live sound feedback so users can hear what other users are playing. Users can also record via the record button and play back tracks. You can play over recorded tracks as well. 
If there are two or more users on piano, you can see what notes other users are pressing
